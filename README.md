# Web Application Security

Web Applications are currently the predominant source of software vulnerabilities exploited in online attacks.Quantity and importance of data entrusted to web applications is growing, and defenders need to learn how to secure them. Traditional network defences, such as firewalls, fail to secure web applications.  There is a growing need and demand for web programmers to be security literate.
This course introduces these potential risks and helps students to better understand web application vulnerabilities, thus enabling them to properly defend organizationsâ€™ web assets. This course covers the main types of web application vulnerabilities and current professional coding and testing best practices to be able to successfully develop and test secure web applications.
